# Senmei - MKV player and upscaler in browser

Very important thing I noticed is what minimal PoC I can make to confirm that my idea works:

- I can upscale anime screenshots using high-end Anime4K profile

A few options I had:

- First set up MKV player and make it ready for providing frames
- Write image upscaler

Obviously, I went with an image upscaler - I pick an image and run the upscaler shaders.
For starters, I went with one only.
